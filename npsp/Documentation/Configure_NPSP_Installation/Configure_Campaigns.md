About Campaigns
Campaigns combine several sources of data in one place to make it easier to analyze the results of a call
to action.
For example, a Campaign could summarize the number of people targeted in a fundraising appeal, how
many responded, and the amount of money raised.
Note The following configurations simply align your Campaign record types with what is provided in
the latest NPSP trial. If you're looking for more advice on how to use and implement Campaigns,
see the Campaigns for Fundraising Implementation Guide.
